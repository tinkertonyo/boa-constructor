  excluded UI elements: Palette tab names, View names, Preference help strings,
                        startup messages, command-line help, 


-- 0.5.0 (CVS) --

2006-10-10

* wxPython 2.7/Python 2.5 compatibility
* Internationalisation (I18N) support:
  * IDE language preference setting:
    Preferences->General->Miscellaneous->i18nLanguage
    People willing to translate the IDE UI strings to their own
    languages please contact me.
    I recommend poEdit for managing the catalogs.
  * Design time support for i18n _() strings in the generated source.
    See Examples/i18n/*
* Improved design time sizer/control creation:
  * Sizers and controls are now automatically linked up
    or added as sizer items when the sizers and control are
    created from the Palette on the Designer.
  * Added some missing FlexGridSizer properties
* Improved unicode source handling
  * Using the coding delaration if defined (# -*- coding: name -*- )
  * Handling for utf8 bom
  * Bugfixes
* Much better support for running Boa from an exe
  * Option to use image modules generated by resourcepackage so
    all images can be bundled inside the exe
    See Scripts/ManageImageResourcePackage.py
  * Fixed problems with debugging from an exe.
    (Remember that the debug server still has to run from source)
* Added new controls to the Palette:
  * wx:     Listbook, Choicebook, GIFAnimationCtrl, MediaCtrl
  * wx.lib: ScrollPanel, HyperLinkCtrl, AnalogClock, FileBrowseButtons,
            MultiSplitterWindow, Throbber, Ticker, DragScroller
* Support for using wx.ArtProvider for bitmap properties in the Designer
  * When the file dialog opens from the property editor, set the 
    Image Type to ArtProvider and click Open, the ArtProvider dialog
    will open.
  * If you want to install your own custom ArtProviders into the IDE,
    you need to write a Boa plug-in that installs your ArtProvider
    (e.g. wx.ArtProvider.PushProvider()) and also append your custom
    artid strings to the PaletteStore.artProviderArtIds list.
    (An example will be provided soon)
* SVN file explorer support (under Plug-ins)
  * Works almost exactly like the current CVS support
  * Requires command-line svn to be installed on your machine
* Better command-line completion on modules imported in your code
  * Set Preferences->General->Editor->importOnCodeComplete to True
    to turn on this feature.
    It tries to import the specified modules in the Shell namespace.
    It's off by default because importing arbitrary modules can
    be dangerous.
* -wxVersionSelect, -W command-line switch, for specifying a 
   wxPython version


-- 0.4.4 (Release) --

2005-07-11

  Eggert Magnusson.
* Added support for wx.GridBagSizer
* Added property editors for BackgroundStyle and WindowVariant
* Fixed Inspector redraw issues


-- 0.4.3 (CVS) --

2005-05-18

* Converted all core/plugins/example code to wxPython 2.5 style code.
  The migration to 2.5 is now complete :)
* Improved Code Completion and Call Tips.
  * Bugfixes for 2.5 style wx code completion/call tips.
  * Using wx.py.introspect for shell call tips.
  * Added code completion/call tips for local/global variables if their
    type could be picked up from the scope in which the name is used.
* IDE Framework registration api in Plugins.py.
  * registerFileType(Controller, Model=None, newName='', addToNew=True, aliasExts=())
  * registerPalettePage(paletteName, paletteTitle)
  * registerComponent(paletteName, Control, controlName, Companion)
  * registerTool(name, func, bmp='-', key='')
  * registerLanguageSTCStyle(name, lang, STCClass, stylesFile, insertPos=None)
  * registerPreference(pluginName, prefName, defPrefValSrc, docs=[], info='')
  * All core and plugin code updated to use the api.
    This hopefully makes extending Boa less cryptic.
* Bugfixes, code cleanups, removed wxPython <= 2.4 special cased code.
* Python modernizations.
  e.g. List Comps instead of "map(lambda" and *arg passing instead of "apply()"


-- 0.4.2 (CVS) --

2005-05-06

* Bugfixes, code cleanups.
* Conversion of all gui filetype modules in the core to 2.5 style code.

* Added preference setting to toggle specialiased Zope debugging 
  (for PythonScripts and PageTemplates), now off by default.
  * Debug speed is much faster without Zope support for cpu intensive code.
* Copy to clipboard from selection in the help controller.


-- 0.4.1 (CVS) --

2005-04-08

* Bugfixes.
* You can now combine frame attributes and custom classes.
  * In other words you may define a custom class that maps to a frame attribute.
  * This allows you to specify controls at run time by passing the class as a 
    parameter and binding it to a frame attribute. 


-- 0.4.0 (Release) --

2005-03-17

* Updated the Designer to parse and generate wxPython 2.5 style code.

2004-08-25

* Primarily a bugfix release
* Fixes issues with attribute resolution in the Designer, small issue with 
  unicode handling and the Zope debugger product.


-- 0.3.0 (Release) -- 

2004-08-17

* Started with the conversion to wxPython 2.5 compatible code, but it's 
  currently impossible to support both 2.4 and 3.5 in the GUI Designer 
  because of the wx namespace change. 
  In __version__.py, wx_version_max can be set to None to run under 2.5, 
  but beware that there are still many issues under 2.5 and the Designer 
  doesn't work.
* BoaDebugger zope product added as an alternative/improved interface for 
  debugging Zope, thanks to Robert Boulanger. See Debugger/BoaDebugger/*
* Added properies/events:
  * wxComboBox enter event
  * wxTextCtrl.MaxLength (thanks Oleg Deribas)

  * Fixed problem with window id handling
  * Fixed Sizer and linked Sizer properties
  * Fixed KeyError bug if renaming after recreating a control in the Designer.
  * Fixed consistency problem with multi-line vs single-line indent and comment  
    Thanks to Tim Diggins for report and initial patch
  * Improved error messages in case of user changed GUI code. 

-- 0.2.8 (CVS) --

* Improved EOL handling
  * Converting (Edit->Convert...)
  * Mode switching (Edit->STC settings...)
  * Warning when mixed EOLs are detected
* Added application todo view
  * On app module, Views->Application todos
  * Gives navigatible app wide todo list
* Much improved support for maskededit family of controls
* Added page about Sizers to the application help
  * It's not linked to yet, but can be opened in a browser,
    at Docs/boa/apphelp/Sizers.html
* Many bug fixes
  * Fixed process freezing if printing > 4k text
  * Sizer, Designer and Editor bugs
  * BicycleRepairMan plug-in bugs


-- 0.2.7 (CVS) --

2003-10-13

* Support for wxWizards
  On the New Palette page see, wxWizard, wxPyWizardPage and
  wxWizardPageSimple.
  It is your own responsibility to create the pages and run
  the wizard.
* Support for the masked edit family of controls:
  wxMaskedTextCtrl, wxIpAddrCtrl, wxMaskedComboBox,
  wxMaskedNumCtrl, wxTimeCtrl, wxIntCtrl
  wxPython 2.4.2.4 is required.
* Feature additions/fixes to the Debugger:
  * Improved remote debugging capabilities by providing
    client<->server filepath mappings.
  * Added a Jump action/change execution point
    supported by Python 2.3.
  * Added script that supports hooking the Boa debugger
    to sys.excepthook. See Debugger/sysexcepthook.
* Improvements to sizers:
  * Navigation to control/sizer by double clicking
    in the collection editor on an item.
  * Invalid sizer choices removed from the Sizer
    property list.
  * Less pedantic on which designer view you have to
    click to create a new sizer or data object.
    It now automatically switches to the right
    designer view and creates the control there.
  * Many sizer bugs fixed.
* Improved process management
  * Now using wxProcess instead of Python's popen.
  * This means we have access to pids under windows
    and also the ability to kill processes.
  * A list of processes started from Boa is now available
    as a page called Tasks in the Error/Output notebook.
  * You will be prompted at shutdown if there are any
    sub-processes still running.
* Re-added non-us keyboard support.
  Please test this if you use Alt-Gr.
  Set under Preferences->General->Editor->handleSpecialEuropeanKeys
  and euroKeysCountry
* New toolbutton support through DoAddTool. This provides
  labels and checked/radio tools.
* Many bug fixes and small improvements.


-- 0.2.6 (CVS) --

2003-08-13

* Micro release sorts out some issues on Linux and other small changes and fixes. 


-- 0.2.5 (CVS) --

2003-08-12

* Collection Editors can now add multiple methods to collections
  This means the following properties have these methods:
  * wxToolBar.Tools : AddTool, AddContol, AddSeparator
  * wxImageList.Images : Add, AddWithColourMask
  * wxMenu.Items : Append, AppendMenu, AppendSeparator
* Collection Editor items can be reordered by clicking the Up and Down 
  arrows on the Collection Editor toolbar.
* Support added for using Sizers in the Designer.
  * All standard sizers added:
    * wxBoxSizer, wxGridSizer, wxFlexGridSizer, wxStaticBoxSizer,
      wxNotebookSizer
    * They are available from the Containers/Layout page
  * Sizers have their own view like the Data View.
  * Visual cues and selectors are drawn around sizered controls in 
    yellow and green.
  * Can navigate to the sizer by right clicking on sizered selection tag 
    (like Anchors)
  * None values are used in empty Sizer items, this is valid in the
    Designer, but you will be warned when a session is posted that still
    contain these None values as they are not valid outside the Designer
    and can cause wxPython to crash.
    Items with None values are visually indicated with the standard
    red dashed style.
  * Connect Sizers to controls via the Sizer property of a control.
  * Add sizer items (window, sizer and spacer items) from the Items 
    collection property of a sizer (double-click)
    Link the item to a window or sizer in the Inspector.
  * Currently sizer layout is applied in addition to absolute coordinate
    positioning and sizes. 
    Hopefully this can be balanced to a best of both worlds approach.
  * See Examples/layout/SizersInBoa.py
* Python Resource modules now available as an alternative way to use
  images.
  * Accepts the format generated by wxPython.tools.img2py, only requires
    that the file starts with this header: #Boa:PyImgResource:
  * Resource modules have an Images view of their contents.
  * Bitmap property editors can open resource modules and generate the 
    appropriate code.
  * The ImageEditor plug-in can convert images to PyImgResource modules.
    It can also edit images directly inside resource modules.
  * See Examples/images/ResourceModules/
* EOL handling in source files have been completely redone.
  * File EOL is now detected and used per file. New files use the OS
    default.
  * Copy pasting code into your source from outside Boa should no longer
    cause mixed EOL issues on Windows.
  * Files are now always opened in binary mode.
  * At startup source templates (used by code genration) are initialised
    with the OS default EOL. 
    Tabs/Spaces in source templates are also set at startup.
* ModuleFinder plug-in, enter the import name to find the file in
  sys.path and open the module in the IDE. Available from Tools.
* Converted the FormatParagraph IDLE extension to be a Boa plug-in.
* Added wxTreeListCtrl and wxListView to the Palette.
* Errors & Output notebook now has menu to load/save the history.
* Many plug-ins now have their images embedded in their source.
* Added feature to the debugger to display the value of a watch or a 
  name in the Output window. 
  * This is useful for big values like large lists or dicts.
  * Ctrl-double-click is the shortcut for this action.
* Also added Preference to minimize Debugger on running. Useful for GUI
  apps.
  Minimizing only works properly on Windows.
* Support for editing/browsing tar.gz files, like zip files work now.
* Editor toolbar should behave better on wxMAC.


-- 0.2.4 (CVS) --

2003-07-10

* Pervasive changes was made to the code to use string methods. 
  Also a few lambda -> list comprehension translations.
* Added BicycleRepairMan (Python Refactoring) support.
  First install BicycleRepairMan, then enable it under
  Preferences->Plug-ins->Plug-in files
  and restart Boa.
  From the Edit menu the following actions are supported:
  BRM - Find references
  BRM - Find definition
  BRM - Rename
  BRM - Extract method
  BRM - Extract local variable
  BRM - Inline local variable
  BRM - Undo last
  From the File menu a module can be explicitly loaded into
  the context.
  Modules can also be added from the Explorer in file system
  folders.
* In the process of adding the BRM support, I extended Boa's
  model/view/controller baseclasses to allow Plugins to extend
  existing MVC interfaces.
* Help Book support. Boa can now manage .hhp, .hhc and .hhk files.
  Different views allow you to define the file list and
  drag and drop to create the contents tree and indexes.
* Help books available in the Boa help can now be changed under
  Preferences->Help books in the Explorer.
* Help now has a PyDoc help page, similar in functionality to
  the Tkinter pydoc search dialog installed with Python, but
  integrated in the Help window.
* Zip Transport now allows write/clipboard operations.
  Create a new blank archive by right clicking and selecting
  New->Empty zip archive from a File system folder.
* Default resource config files are now stored in Config and
  no longer in the Boa root.
  If $HOME is defined .boa-constructor is now used as default
  instead of .boa, to be the same as the Debian boa.
* Plugin Preference storage changes.
  __init__.plug-in.py file no longer used.
  To avoid writing to Plug-ins directory this info is now stored
  in Explorer.*.cfg
* Plug-ins can now automatically expose Preference settings,
  available from: Preferences->Plug-ins->Preferences
* Plug-in filetypes (Pascal, Java, Pyrex) now generate their
  STC config files automatically and store them in the resource
  config directory instead of in Plug-ins.
* The Shell can now be either be the Boa Shell, PyCrust or
  entirely turned off.
  See Preferences->General->Shell->psPythonShell
* The Explorer page can also be turned off, but this is not
  recommended unless you have a good reason as things like
  Preferences or Zope are only available through the Explorer.
* Filesystem items can be Inspected to see file attributes like
  creation and modification date.
* wxSTC/wxHTMLWindow views now have the option to print.
* A new Tools menu has been added to the main menu.
* Simple regex editor/matcher window now available under Tools.
  It's very simple but still handy.
* New Palette page "wxPython.lib", currently only has wxGenStaticText.
  This is now the recommended replacement for wxStaticText as it
  behaves properly in the Designer on Linux.
* Fixed bug in wxSplitterWindow companion where deletion could
  lead to a crash.
* Added explicit config files for the __WXMAC__ platform and also
  hopefully improved initial layout.
* Wrote a simple Explorer wrapper so the wxPython demo can be "hosted"
  in Boa. I still use Robin's excellent demo often and it's handy to
  have the code directly in Boa
  Turned off by default, turn on under
  Preferences->Plug-ins->Plug-in files, and restart Boa.
* Input page, typically for non-gui Python scripts that read from
  the keyboard (stdin).
  It appears as a page on the TraceBack/Output/Error notebook.
  To turn on choose: File->Toggle use input stream
* Also new for the TraceBack/Error/Output notebook, it's history
  can be browsed from the new buttons on the statusbar. 


-- 0.2.3 (Release) --

2003-04-01

* Primarily a bugfix release
* Some changes to improve handling of non-ASCII source, 
  see Docs/boa/apphelp/NonASCII.html


-- 0.2.2 (CVS) --

2003-03-14

* A bugfix release, mostly to handle wxNotebook.AddPage parameter signature 
  change. 
  * Script added to update generated code: Scripts/UpgradeNotebookParams.py


-- 0.2.1 (CVS) --

2003-02-02

* A bugfix release, mostly to handle the "import string" problem.


-- 0.2.0 (Release) --

2003-01-13

* Added Zope ExternalMethod for runtime hooking of the debugger.
  No longer need to run z2.py from the IDE, see the Debugger page in the docs.
* Changes to accommodate MacOS X, many, many problems remain, but Boa can now
  at least start up on MacOS X! Thanks to Kevin Altis.
* Added plug-in for using XRC files.
* Many minor bug fixes


-- 0.1.5 (CVS) --

2003-01-03

* Generated source can now be wrapped over multiple lines.
  Lines are only broken up after commas, inside brackets,
  but this works well enough.
  3 new Preferences added to the General->Code generation
  section. This feature is now on by default.
* I've abandoned the strategy of renaming plug-ins to disable them. 
  This was too unfriendly for things like CVS.
  Also plug-ins can now be ordered.
  Both these changes are implemented with a new file called
  __init__.plug-in.py in your Plug-ins directory which defines the 
  list of disabled and ordered plugin names.
  Ordered plug-ins are executed first (in order!) 
  Everything can be managed thru the GUI under
  Preferences->Plug-ins->Plug-in files.
* Improved Find/Replace dialog.
  Now supports 'Find in files' and seaching in the Explorer.
  Thanks to Roman Yakovenko for the patches!
* Refactored Controller menu/toolbar definitions to use the
  same format that View menu/toolbar definitions uses.
  One visible result of this is that menu items can now display images.
* Improved tab support. The frame designer can now properly generate 
  tab indented code.
  People who care about this, please test as I don't use this.  
* Added ImageEditor.plug-in.py.
  This is an image editor I hacked up ages ago.
  (I needed masked PNG support!)
  I just wrapped up the editor as a Boa View.
  It's rough but it works ;)
  (Hint: When editing images with masks, set the mask again before
         saving, otherwise the previous mask is used)
* Shortcut keys now work better on Linux (Ctrl-S works!!!).
* Composite controls like wxGrid now work properly in the Designer 
  on Linux.
  Unfortunately many other controls still misbehave on Linux :(
* Added wxSpinCtrl
* Zope: Added SiteErrorLog support. 
  Just delete your zoa folder in your Zope root and the new
  zoa will be automatically installed.
* Removed the bundled PyChecker from the repository.
  Boa now tries to use the one installed on your system.

    word variables currently, clicking adds as watch.
* Support for C++ source
* Added ToolTipString property
* Added Style constructor parameter
* Python 2.0 compatibility
* Traceback browser:
  * jump to source from a tree ctrl showing exception tracebacks
  * Create a traceback tree from a Boa.trace file
* New palette look saving some space.
* Modules are parsed when needed allowing snappier opening - Shane Hathaway
* Auto created frames (main frame) works correctly.
* Code browsing/jumping/marking history (back and forward buttons)
* More code completion support (but not enough yet)
  * wxPython methods for wxPython object decendants
  * Attribute type and methods
* Limited support for distutils (Setup module)

00-03-01 - 00-08-30

* Put the website into Zope 
* Put application help into Zope 
* Added CVS view to the Explorer
* Links to wxWindows documentation from the Companion classes are now 
  generated by a script
* Moved all image loading into an ImageStore cache type object
* Changed Boa to not have to be started in the Boa directory
* Added find in application
* Syntax highlighting editor
  * Auto indent
  * Smart delete
  * Indent blocks
  * Comment blocks
  * Breakpoints & Tracepoints
  * Code browsing (limited support)
    Hold down ctrl and move the cursor over code, click on 
    underlined code to browse to it
  * Code completion, currently only object attributes self.*
* OGL improvements including saving of position
* Keyboard support in the Inspector, Editor and Designer
* Added Zope interface
* Fixed a lot of little bugs in the Inspector
* Added a MenuBar for the Editor
* Added About box
* Made a subset of views optional
* Added ClassLink property editor for controls linking to
  other controls
* Added FrameBars
* Added the python profiler
* Added Tim Peter's Cyclops, cycle finder
* Controls that don't accept mouse clicks 
  (wxNotebook, wxStaticLine, wxStaticBox)
  are now selectable and dragable
* Added context sensitive help (press F1 in source code)
* Added CollectionEditors
  These are new properties on components which provides 
  design-time item list maintenance.
  In the source, each Collection Editor looks after its
  own method.
  This is a rough first draft and will be refined.
  A very big gotcha with most of these collection properties
  is that they are not live. For most you will have to close 
  open and reopen the Designer for changes to take effect :(
  Please note that whitespace is even more meaningful
  than usual ;) So leave generated code as is!
  The following have been implemented to various degrees:
  * wxListCtrl.Columns
  * wxStatusBar.Fields
  * wxImageList.Images (plus image enabled editor)
  * wxNotebook.Pages
  * wxWindow.Constraints
  * wxToolBar.Tools (plus EVT_TOOL)
  * wxMenuBar.Menus 
  * wxMenu.Items (plus EVT_MENU)
  Still to be implemented:
  * wxAcceleratorTable.Entries (broken, doesn't fit yet)
  * wxBoxSizers, wxStaticBoxSizer
  * Sub menus
  * Different types of insertion methods 
* Directory compare (lib's cmp) and diff facilities (Tim Peter's ndiff)
* Fixed many memory leaks and circular references
