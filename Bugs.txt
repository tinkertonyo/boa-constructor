Bugs & Issues 
-------------

Under wxGTK, Num Lock *must* be turned off. Because of a strange bug in 
wxWidgets having Num Lock on is the same as holding in Alt. 
This causes the short cuts to trigger, e.g. pressing "S" in the Editor
would cause the Save As dialog to pop up because Alt-S is registered.
The only know solution for wxPython 2.4.2.4 is to turn off Num Lock.

Current Designer behaviour may seem weird where a
single control is dropped on a frame; At first the control keeps its
default size, but when the frame is resized, it fills the frame.
(toolbars, statusbars and menubars connected to the frame are 
excepted from this rule)
This behaviour emulates the way frames/containers auto sizes a control 
if only one is dropped on a frame/container, but it gives you the 
chance to add a second control (before it fills the parent). 
If you have a control filling a parent and want to add another to
the parent, resize/move it out of the way and drop the second
(painful I know)

White space is quite significant for collection item methods!
The spacing/blank lines within the method delimit the 3 possible
sections, I might change this to rather be delimited by comments
(but I don't want to have meaningfull comments either :( )
Anyway don't mess with the whitespace and expect this to change.

Another biggish gotcha is that changes to many (there are exceptions) 
constructor properties and collection item constructor properties 
will only take effect after the frame has been opened and closed
or the property refreshed.
This is partially due to constructors only being called once ;)

Cyclops and wxGenButtons don't mix for some strange reason. Disable
any wxGenButtons code before running Cyclops.
To run Boa in Cyclops, turn the cyclopsing flag on in Palette.py

Other bugs
----------

Recreate controls not implemented for the Data View.

ToolBars confuse the Designer somtimes (and the author).
Components are offset by the height of the toolbar

Toolbars still cause big trouble by moving the frame coordinates down
when linked to a frame.
The only way I can see this working is by always having the toolbar
as the first component and immediately linking it before creating any
other components (this breaks the pattern completely ouch :()
Also have to compensate for all top level controls (ctrls directly on
frame) by adjusting their coordinates upon linking of the toolbar,
because their source won't be updated.
The moral of the story is to not have controls directly on a frame for
now, rather put them in a panel, this is the recommended procedure
in any case.

Parser must be fixed sometime to correctly parse
nested methods and nested classes

Sometimes get a DeadObject assertion error when using the debugger by attaching
to it.

GTK
---

Under RedHat 8, fonts are sometimes displayed incorrectly, the suggested 
workaround is to have an environment variable like this defined:
LANG=en_US

GTK Critical warnings are produced in the following cases:
- When there is a 'New' submenu connected under 'File'. Off by default on wxGTK.
- When controls are reparented from the Notebook to another control. 
  - This now causes a coredump :(

Find in App does not search app

moduleparse.Module.name sometimes have extension, sometimes not. Decide!

Remove the silly assert for local uris (assertLocalFile), should be 
checkLocalFile that raises a TransportError

Check AccelEnter -> Notebook paste bug

refreshCtrl is called twice on open pyd

Snap to grid snaps more to left/top sides

Filenames starting with . aren't handled correctly.

moduleparse does not pick up 1st variable if defined before any other construct

F10 outside Boa seems to set the dir according to app, breaks traceback.
Clue; seems os.cwd is sometimes used.

When an App is closed, it's remaining open modules stil refer to it.

Inspector page splitter sometimes ends up in the center of the page after
selecting nothing.
